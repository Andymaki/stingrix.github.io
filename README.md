# StingriX kernel
🔧 Introduction
StingriX is a minimal, independent kernel project designed to be simple, lightweight, and educational. Its purpose is not to compete with production-grade kernels but to provide:

🛠 A minimal foundation with only the essentials
🧑‍💻 An educational environment for those curious about kernel development
🔧 A lightweight base for experiments in operating system design
🎯 A personal project that may evolve with community input
This project is entirely built by one young developer, motivated by curiosity and the desire to learn. StingriX is currently in its very early stages, more of a proof of concept than a complete operating system kernel.
