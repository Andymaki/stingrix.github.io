<h1>StingriX — an experimental kernel</h1>
<p class="muted">A personal kernel project built and maintained by a single teenage developer. This website documents the project's goals, progress and how to follow along.</p>

<div class="warning">
⚠️ WARNING: StingriX is an experimental kernel made by a <strong>single teenage developer</strong>. There is <strong>no</strong> stable public release yet. Installing pre-release software can cause data loss, hardware issues or other problems. Use only in safe testing environments.

<h2>What is StingriX?</h2>
<p>StingriX is a small, learning-first kernel built from scratch. It is not Linux-based: it is intended to explore kernel design, low-level programming and the steps required to boot and run minimal systems. The initial public release will be an extremely minimal beta for testing core functionality.</p>


<h3>Initial goals</h3>
<ul>
<li>Provide a tiny, auditable kernel that boots and demonstrates core concepts.</li>
<li>Serve as a learning platform for low-level development.</li>
<li>Grow gradually — features and hardware support will be added over time.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Expectations</h3>
<ul>
<li>The first public beta will be minimal and mostly for testing.</li>
<li>Because this is a one-person project, progress will be iterative and paced by the developer.</li>
<li>Contributions, feedback and constructive testing help the project improve.</li>
</ul>
